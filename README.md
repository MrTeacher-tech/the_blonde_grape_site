Front End Flex

To get full functionality you will need to serve it up. If using Visual Studio, the live server extension works great. If you have python installed, navigate to the directory and then run 'python3 -m http.server'.

I was going to start teaching myself Django (I have used Node.js for projects in the past) but figured I could just make this to show off some front end stuff with bootstrap and javascript. I know I should have designed a text logo as opposed to shadowing html text with css but I was lazy, I'll show off my illustrator skills another time. I included a file with links to all the recipes whose images I borrowed.

Hope you're hungry!
